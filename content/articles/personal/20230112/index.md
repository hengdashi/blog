Today is Jan 12, 2023. I decided to rebuild this personal blog and start to leave my mental footprints in this universe.

Last night, I was watching a youtube plaque unboxing video by **the** youtuber who keeps me away from uninstalling youtube, and suddenly realized how important it is to snapshot moments of my life, either mentally and/or physically. Watching and feeling the joy of being recognized by the larger community is truly mentally satisfying. I feel so satisfied just by watching the video, can’t imagine how thrilled he is.

And so I decided to rebuild this site, hoping this place will keep my snapshots even beyond the end of my time. I’ll log my personal thoughts, as well as interesting projects I’ve done related to ml and engineering.

Last year has been an awful year for me. I’ve never been so emotional and depressed in my entire life, even though many good things happened too. I hope this year will be wonderful for me and my family, and I wish everyone’s wishes come true.

Best,

I'm a **data scientist** working for [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/) on Machine Learning (ML) models for our internal search engine.

I love **open source** and work on interesting side projects outside of work. I also [blog](/articles/) about anything that interests me. I'm sorry if you see me ranting here and there :upside_down_face: because I also blog my personal life occasionally.

I'm a machine learning engineer living in Los Angeles, CA. I currently work for [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/), a job board platform.

Nowadays, I spend most of my time developing large scale machine learning systems, mostly on search, but also have interests in multimodal LLMs and more.

I take photos :camera: and drink coffee :coffee:.
I own a Hasselblad X2D with two lens (38V and 75P), and love zooming into a 100MP photo and count the animal hairs :sunglasses:.
I also own a Gaggia espresso machine and modded it with [gaggiuino](https://gaggiuino.github.io/), just so I can play with different brewing profiles.
My current favorite bag is a Columbia Gesha from [Nomad Coffee Spain](https://nomadcoffee.es/).
I will occasionally share photos and espresso (after I setup a photo album!).

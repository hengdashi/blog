# About Me

Welcome! My name is *Hengda Shi*.

I am currently a graduate student pursuing 
a Master Degree in Computer Science at [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/). I graduated from UCLA in 2019 with a Bachelor Degree in Compute Science (centennial class!!).

I am mainly interested in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [hardware acceleration techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator) of machine learning algorithms.

This tech blog is created to document my journey in Computer Science as I am really bad at *memorization*. Hopefully you would find it useful to some extent as well.

My resume is included [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hengdashi/resume/master/hengda_resume.pdf) if you are interested.

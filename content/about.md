Welcome! My name is *Hengda Shi*.

I am currently a data scientist on the search team at [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/).
I graduated from [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) in March 2021 with master and June 2019 with bachelor degree both in Compute Science (centennial class!!).

My interests lie in the field of machine learning, ranging from object detection, to graph neural networks, eventually to large language models.
I'm also interested in [hardware acceleration techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator) of machine learning algorithms.

This tech blog is created to document my journey in Computer Science as I am really bad at *memorization*.
The hope is you would find some contents useful as well.
